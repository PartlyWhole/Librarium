# Requests

Feature and change requests for Librarium: **you write, the AI answers here.**

## How it works

1. **You** add a request under **Inbox** in your own words. A line is enough; an example,
   a screenshot path or "why" helps. Copy the template below if you like.
2. **The AI** (at the start of each session, or when asked) takes each Inbox item:
   - gives it a number (`R-NNN`) and moves it to **In progress**;
   - asks you under **Waiting for you** when only you can decide (it never guesses at those);
   - when done, moves it to **Done** (newest first) with the answer: what changed, how to use
     it, where it is in the code, the commits and decision records, what was tested, and what
     is left.
3. **You** check Done. If something isn't right, write a new Inbox item that refers to the
   number (`About R-012: …`).

Your words are kept as you wrote them (quoted under each answer). Deeper design notes live
in `docs/decisions/`; how the code is organised, in `docs/DEVELOPING.md`.

### Template

## Inbox

<!-- Write new requests here, newest at the bottom. -->

### No duplicate tabs
What I want: "Don't see in a point of duplicate tabs (two tabs of the same file/page)"
Why / example: three tabs all showing the note 2026-10-03 (screenshot, 2026-10-03).

### The side panel
What I want: "Really don't like side panel"
Why / example: screenshot (2026-10-03) of the panel for a note: Linked from, Links without a
target, Outline, History and Jobs (a long list of "Refreshing link labels 2026-10-03"), all
stacked in one column.

## Waiting for you

### R-021 · Images in notes: where should they live?
- **Question:** when you paste or drop an image into a note, should it become a **library
  item** (with its own ID, shown in Library, linked as `![[…]]`), or a **plain file in an
  `attachments/` folder** next to your notes (standard `![](attachments/x.png)`, readable by
  other Markdown apps)?
- **Context:** the first fits the app's "everything has an ID" rule; the second is more
  portable. Images in notes can't be built until this is decided. (From R-020's follow-ups.)

### R-022 · The keychain prompt while saving web pages
- **Question:** WebKit sometimes asks the keychain for a "WebCrypto Master Key" when a page is
  saved. You deny these prompts. Options: (a) leave it (deny is harmless), (b) you add a
  permission rule, (c) turn off web encryption for saved pages (some pages may then
  misbehave). An approach that supplied our own key through a private WebKit hook was refused
  for safety and needs your explicit decision.

## Done

### R-020 · Fold lists and headings like Obsidian
> "Doesn't look great how bullet lists are collapsed including nested lists"

- **Changed:** the fold arrow now sits just left of each bullet or heading (not in one column
  at the far left); it shows on hover and while folded. A folded line ends in a faint "…"
  (click to unfold) and its bullet gets a ring.
- **Use:** hover a list item or heading and click its arrow; ⌥⌘[ / ⌥⌘] at the cursor.
- **Code:** `src/editor/folding.ts`; styles in `src/shell/shell.css` ("Folding").
- **Commits:** `4f1c144` · **Decision:** 0037 · **Tested:** interface tests; checked in the
  preview (positions measured).

### R-019 · Nested bullet lists were misaligned
> "Why is the bullet list so messed up"

- **Changed:** a list item's indentation and marker are drawn in the monospace font, so each
  level steps in evenly; wrapped lines hang under the item's text; the bullet no longer
  inherits the line's negative indent.
- **Code:** `src/editor/lists.ts` (`hangingIndent`), `.cm-list-prefix` / `.cm-bullet` styles.
- **Commits:** `058e849` · **Decision:** 0037.

### R-018 · First-class writing, and version history
> "Create a well-designed plan for the editor + version control. Compact, then implement."
> Decisions: `.librarium` is acceptable; delete permanently erases a note's history;
> retention as proposed.

- **Changed (editor):** live preview per construct (link IDs never shown); ⌘B ⌘I ⇧⌘X ⇧⌘H ⌘E
  ⌘K ⌘L ⌥⌘1–6 ⌥⌘0 and a Format menu; wrapping a selection with `* _ = \` ~`; multiple
  cursors (⌘D, ⌥-click, ⌥-drag); Tab/⇧Tab move list items with children, renumbering; HTML
  pasted as Markdown, ⇧⌥⌘V plain; copy gives `[[label]]` to other apps; code highlighting;
  folding; word count; Outline panel; clicking an unresolved link makes the note; custom link
  text survives renames.
- **Changed (history):** notes, daily notes and captures keep versions in
  `.librarium/history` (one log per Mac; safe with iCloud); spaced 5 minutes while writing,
  plus outside edits and restores; retention: all for a day, hourly for a week, daily for 90
  days, weekly after. History (⌥⌘Y) compares and restores (with Undo); Archive lists notes
  deleted outside the app and brings them back.
- **Code:** `src/editor/*` (one file per part), `crates/kernel/src/history.rs`, the history API
  in `crates/api/src/lib.rs`, `src/features/notes/history.ts`.
- **Commits:** `4531f98` (plan, developer guide) `b2cd668` `c987ad6` `fde3541` `1fe30d3`
  `6baae12` `fa33650` `13c19b8` · **Decisions:** 0037, 0038 · **Plan:**
  `docs/plans/editor-and-history.md` · **Tested:** Vitest (editor, clipboard, lists, history
  UI), kernel and API tests (history, retention, two Macs, deletion).
- **Left:** hover previews, callouts, `#tags`, images in notes (R-021), tables, properties,
  templates, math, focus mode; history for library items.

### R-017 · Research Obsidian's editor and version control
> "Please research Obsidian markdown editor quality/features…" · "Research deeply also how
> Obsidian handles version control"

- **Done:** two research reports; their findings and choices are in
  `docs/plans/editor-and-history.md`, decisions 0037 and 0038. Led to R-018.

### R-016 · Links opened inside the app, with no way back
> "I clicked a link inside the app, and it took me to a webpage… it should ask if I want to
> open it (in a browser) with details about the link"

- **Changed:** a link to the web asks first: its words, where it goes, the full address, from
  which page, a warning if misleading or not secure; Cancel / Copy link / Open in browser. The
  window can never navigate away (a guard in the app).
- **Code:** `src/shell/links.ts`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (`stays_in_app`), `app.openUrl`.
- **Commits:** `829695c` · **Decision:** 0036.

### R-015 · Daily notes as ordinary notes
> "No need to create a special folder/group… a button on the ribbon to create a new daily
> note (or open it)… lands in the root… treated just like a note"

- **Changed:** no Daily notes group; Today (ribbon, ⇧⌘D) opens or makes today's note at the
  top level of Notes; it is a normal note that still knows its day (`daily.date`).
- **Commits:** `6eb8698` · **Decision:** 0035.

### R-014 · Tabs like Obsidian
> "Please add tabs support like Obsidian"

- **Changed:** a tab bar; each tab has its own history and keeps its page alive; ⌘T new, ⌘W
  close, ⇧⌘T reopen, ⌃Tab / ⌘1–9 switch; middle-click and "Open in new tab"; tabs restored
  on start. Today moved to ⇧⌘D; Close window is ⇧⌘W.
- **Code:** `src/shell/router.ts`, `src/shell/tabs.ts`, page hosting in `src/shell/shell.ts`.
- **Commits:** `5c3a3c8` · **Decision:** 0034.

### R-013 · Notes and Library each with their own folders; captures under items
> "Just a notes panel with their own folders and a library panel… captures… should be
> children of the library items" (and: the Notes page said "No notes yet")

- **Changed:** separate folders per kind; the Notes and Library pages are the Finder-like
  browser; sidebar has just Notes and Library; captures fold under their item; daily notes
  shown, empty-folder note under the header.
- **Commits:** `14eceb9` `084572c` · **Decision:** 0033.

### R-012 · Arrange items by hand
> "Please support positional dragging"

- **Changed:** drop on the top/bottom edge of a row (left/right of an icon) to place it; the
  folder switches to "As arranged"; ⌥↑/⌥↓ moves the selection; kept in
  `.librarium/order.json`.
- **Commits:** `1d43723` · **Decision:** 0033 (addendum).

### R-011 · Folder organisation like Finder or Google Drive
> "Please add support for and improve UI/UX for folder/file organization and navigation"

- **Changed:** real folders for notes and library items; a browser with list and icon views,
  path, sort, filter, selection (clicks, box, keyboard), rename in place, context menus,
  drag and drop (pointer-based), Undo.
- **Code:** `crates/kernel/src/folders.rs`, `src/shell/folders/`, `src/kit/dnd.ts`.
- **Commits:** `ecddab4` · **Decision:** 0033.

### R-010 · Highlight saved captures in the reader
- **Changed:** captures show as soft highlights in PDFs, images, saved pages and books; a click
  offers "Open capture". · **Commits:** `ae34d22` · **Decision:** 0031.

### R-009 · Popups in saved pages; fade-in text; slow saves
> "Popup was saved…" · "This is unacceptable" · "Is there a way to speed up… webpage saving?"

- **Changed:** popups removed even while fading in or arriving late; animations stilled;
  hidden text revealed; the right main text; saving 5–20× faster; Cancel stops a save at once.
- **Commits:** `95d00b2` `0aaeae2` `e2efad3` `b427d3c` `ed2c0d2` `d6a28ac` `bb44195` ·
  **Decisions:** 0027, 0030.

### R-008 · Jobs: failures explained, stop them (all at once)
> "Why does it still say 5 failed… no information" · "How can I stop jobs" · "Especially
> mass stop"

- **Changed:** failed jobs say why, with Retry and Dismiss (all); Cancel and Cancel all;
  open and close the side panel. · **Commits:** `473ca61` `750b922` `368b7b2`.

### R-007 · Remove old snapshots; select several; select mode
> "Please first add a way to remove them. Support multi-selection" · "Add select mode where
> cmd-a works"

- **Commits:** `34dac57` `73b925f` `473ca61` · **Decision:** 0032.

### R-006 · Archive and delete from a right-click
- **Commits:** `4142db0` · **Decision:** 0029.

### R-005 · Save the whole link list; skip duplicates; stay in the background
> "Please add all articles from link list" · "does it have duplicate detection?… not popup
> everytime"

- **Commits:** `6e41037` `3e695c1` `bac5233` `cf1f886` `b6e2553` `33584c6` ·
  **Decision:** 0027.

### R-004 · Easier captures (several parts, regions that work)
- **Commits:** `2f94239` · **Decision:** 0031.

### R-001 – R-003 · The original build (milestones 0–9) and the real-pages check
- From `PROMPT.md` and `BRIEF.md`; see the README's decision table (0001–0030).
